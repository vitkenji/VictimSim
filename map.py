# Map Class
# @Author: Cesar A. Tacla, UTFPR
#
## A map representing the explored region of the 2D grid
## The map is a dictionaire whose keys are pairs (x, y).
## The map contains only visited positions.
##
## An entry in the dictionary is: [(x,y)] : ( difficulty, vic_id, [actions' results] )
## - (x,y): the key; the position of the grid (or the cell)
## - difficulty: the degree of difficulty to access the cell
## - vic_id: the victim identification number (if there is one) or VS.NO_VICTIM if there is no victim
## - actions' results: the known actions' results from the cell represented as vector of 8 integers, in the following
##   order: [up, up-right, right, down-right, down, down-left, left, up-left]. Each position may
##   have the following values:
##   VS.UNK  the agent ignores if it is possible to go towards the direction (useful if you want
##           to not use the check_walls_and_lim method of the AbstAgent and save only tried actions)
##   VS.WALL the agent cannot execute the action (there is a wall),
##   VS.END  the agent cannot execute the action (end of grid)
##   VS.CLEAR the agent can execute the action
##
## Example of a map entry WITH VICTIM:
## (10, 8): (3.0, 10, [VS.WALL, VS.WALL, VS.CLEAR, VS.CLEAR, VS.WALL, VS.END, VS.END, VS.END])
## the position x=10, y=8 has a difficulty of 3.0 and the victim number 10 is there.
##   +--+--+--+--+
##   !!!|XX|XX|    
##   +--+--+--+--+      AG is the currently visited position (10,8) where the victim 10 is located
##   !!!|AG|  |         XX is a wall (
##   +--+--+--+--+      !! is the end of the grid
##   !!!|XX|  |       
##   +--+--+--+--+
##
## Example of a map entry WITHOUT VICTIM:
## (11, 8): (0, VS.NO_VICTIM,[VS.WALL, VS.CLEAR, VS.CLEAR, VS.CLEAR, VS.CLEAR, VS.WALL, VS.CLEAR, VS.WALL])
