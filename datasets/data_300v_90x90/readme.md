# Files
* `input.txt` was used by `generate_obsts_and_victims.py` to generate the grid with walls, cells with difficult * access, and to disperse 300 victims.
* `env_vital_signals.txt` was generated by the MatLab script `script_geracao_vital_signals.m`

# Train, validation and pre-blind test (TAR 3/2024)
- `rescue_prior.txt`: contains 1280 lines for training a regressor that estimates the rescue priority of a victim given the following features:
  - difficulty of access to the victim (sum of the difficulties of the cells around the victim + the victim's cell),
  - severity level, and
  - Euclidean distance from the victim to the base
  - rescue priority from 0 to 100 (target)
- `rescue_prior_preblind.txt`: contains 300 lines for a pre-blind test of a regressor; the structure is identical to that of rescue_prior.txt, except that it does not have the last column which must be estimated by the regressor.
- `rescue_prior_preblind_target.txt`: contains 300 lines for a pre-blind test of a regressor with the target column
